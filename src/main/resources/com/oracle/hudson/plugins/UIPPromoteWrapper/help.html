<p>The UIP Promote Wrapper is a toggle to tell Hudson that this job is running in the context of an ADE label
creation workflow.  If you do _not_ toggle this, the build will end and the view will be destroyed.  By enabling
this toggle, the job will arrange to promote any DOs created by the build into the current label being constructed.

<p>Teams would never select this for a src-only label</p>

<p>Teams should always use this if they are promoting DOs into an ADE label _and_ they are not explicitly calling the UIP promote task
in one of their build steps.  Essentially, this is a convenience so that teams can avoid interating directly with UIP.
