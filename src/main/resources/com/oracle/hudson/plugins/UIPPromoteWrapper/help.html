<p>This permits teams to incorporate the FMW Release Management bootstrap procedure into a Hudson job.  It bootstraps ANT, JAVA, and MAVEN 
into the current job's Hudson workspace

<p>Please see the <a href="http://aseng-wiki.us.oracle.com/asengwiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=-1514700419">full documentation</a> for a complete description of how the BootStrap process works.  
It is currently maintained by the FMW RM team.

<p>This should only be enabled if teams are <em>not</em> executing the bootstrap module from their setup_env.pl.
