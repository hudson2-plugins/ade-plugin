<div>
	Hello Prototype people.  Only use this if you are trying to create a view of a specific label that is not the "latest".
	I would expect that this would usually (ie always) be a job parameter because a job definition is never going to
	know a priori exactly what label it should use.  This property is always parameter expanded before being used.
