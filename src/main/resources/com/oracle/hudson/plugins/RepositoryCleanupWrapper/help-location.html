<div>
	This is the location of the repository that needs to be cleaned up after the build.  You can use job parameters and 
	environment variables in this expression.  For example, <code>${SCRATCH}/m2</code> would be a valid location and would end 
	up binding to something like /scratch/aime/m2 on the farm.
